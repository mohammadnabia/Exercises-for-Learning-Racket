# Explanation and Tutorial for Image Creation and Lambda Expressions in Racket

## Overview:

This code introduces two key concepts in Racket:

  1- Image creation and manipulation using the 2htdp/image library, which allows for drawing shapes and combining them in different ways.

  2- Lambda expressions, which define anonymous functions, as well as the let construct for local bindings.

## Code Breakdown:

**racket:**
  
  ```Racket
  #lang Racket
  (require 2htdp/image)
  ```

  `This line specifies that the code is written in Racket and imports the 2htdp/image library. This library is used for creating and manipulating images in a simple and intuitive way.`
  
**Drawing Circles:**

  ```Racket
  (circle 100 "solid" "red")
  (circle 10 "solid" "yellow")
  ```
 * `circle:` This function draws a circle with a specified radius, mode, and color.
    * The first argument is the circle's radius (e.g., 100 or 10).
    * The second argument specifies whether the circle is "solid" or "outline".
    * The third argument specifies the color of the circle.

  * In this case:
    * The first line draws a red solid circle with a radius of 100.
    * The second line draws a yellow solid circle with a radius of 10.
  
**Overlaying Circles:**

  ```Racket
  (overlay
         (circle 30 "solid" "black") 
         (circle 40 "solid" "green") 
         (circle 50 "solid" "yellow")
         (circle 60 "solid" "red")
         (circle 70 "solid" "blue"))
  ```

  * `overlay:` This function overlays several images on top of each other.
    The first image will be at the top, and each subsequent image will be placed behind it.
  In this case, five circles of increasing size and different colors are overlaid, with the smallest circle (black) at the front and the largest circle (blue) at the back.

**Arranging Circles Side by Side:**

  ```Racket
  (beside
         (circle 30 "solid" "black") 
         (circle 40 "solid" "green") 
         (circle 50 "solid" "yellow")
         (circle 60 "solid" "red")
         (circle 70 "solid" "blue"))
  ```
