# Explanation and Tutorial for the Sphere Volume Calculation Code in Racket

This piece of code, written in the Racket programming language, is designed to calculate the volume of a sphere. The code inputs the sphere's radius and computes the volume using the corresponding mathematical formula.
* Mathematical Formula:
$` V = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times r^3 `$

where:
* __V__ is the volume of the sphere
* __r__ is the radius of the sphere
* __π__ (Pi) is approximately 3.14

## Code Breakdown:
```Racket
#lang Racket
```
`This line indicates that the code is written in the Racket programming language. It should be placed at the top of every Racket file to specify the language being used.`
```Racket
(define (V r)
```
`Here, a function named V is defined, which takes a single input r. This r represents the radius of the sphere. In Racket, define is used to create functions and variables.`
```Racket
(*‌(‌*(/ 4 3 )3.14)(* r(* r r))))
```
`This line contains the formula to compute the volume of the sphere`

## How to Run the Code:

You can run this code using a Racket development environment such as DrRacket. Simply copy the code into the Racket environment and execute it to see the results.
